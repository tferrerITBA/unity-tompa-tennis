## Tompa Tennis 2020

### Controls

Press UpArrow, DownArrow, LeftArrow, RightArrow to move.
Press Space to hit the ball. Hitting the key repeatedly has no downsides.
Before the player hits the ball (but after pressing Space), you can direct your shot by pressing LeftArrow or RightArrow (if none of these are pressed, the shot will be aimed at the center).
Additionally, if you press DownArrow before hitting the ball (and after pressing Space) the shot will land closer to the net, so the other player will have to run!
Lastly, press ESC if you need to pause the game.

### Rules
The same rules as in regular tennis apply. Basically, don't let the ball bounce twice.

### Deploy
To deploy the game, you need to extract the file 'deploy/deploy.zip' and start a web server, at the extracted directory. You can use the extension [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related).
